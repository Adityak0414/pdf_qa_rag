# ðŸ§  RAG-based QA System for Medical Documents

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline designed to answer medical questions based on the contents of a given PDF document. It uses:

- **PyMuPDF** to extract text from the PDF
- **SentenceTransformers** to embed text chunks
- **Qdrant** (vector database) to store and search embeddings
- **Flan-T5** (local) to generate natural language answers

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `extract_text_from_pdf(path)` â€“ Extracts raw text from the PDF
- `chunk_text_by_sentences(text)` â€“ Chunks the text for better context coherence
- `store_in_qdrant(chunks, model)` â€“ Embeds and stores chunks in a Qdrant collection
- `search_query(query, model, client)` â€“ Retrieves top-k most relevant chunks
- `generate_answer_t5(context, question)` â€“ Uses a local Flan-T5 model to answer questions based on the context

## ðŸ”§ Dependencies

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers qdrant-client pymupdf transformers
